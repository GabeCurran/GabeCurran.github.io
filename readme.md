## Gabe's Personal Page
Welcome to my personal webpage. 
I am a student studying software engineering at Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology.
I plan on becoming as experienced and well-rounded in front-end web development, game-design and the fields alike as I possibly can!

## Interests/Experience
I have mostly worked with:
- Markdown
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- JavaScript DOM

## Projects
My main projects so far have been:
- web based games
- personal websites

## Collaboration/Goals
I have a passion for learning and am doing my best to broaden my reach. Currently, I would like to work on JavaScript games and potentially create modular JavaScript features.
I am also in the midst of learning about database, through Python3 and SQL. I am very interested in learning more about backend web development as well.
