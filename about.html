            <h1>Summary</h1>
            <p>
                I'm a motivated and passionate individual who genuinely cares about quality and people. I strongly value learning new things and acquiring new skills. I've worked on many side projects, aside from computer related topics. Most of those are related to animals, such as my aquariums, raising chickens, and building a proper hermit crab tank in the past.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I also love taking pictures of these things, here's some of it.
