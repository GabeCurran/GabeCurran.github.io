            <p>
                I'm a student with a passion for computers, web design and video games. I'm always looking for ways to learn more and better myself.
            </p>
            <p>
                My current goal is to graduate from Thaddeus Stevens and look for a job or internship in software development while I'm doing it. In the distant future, I hope to pursue a career in data science as well.
