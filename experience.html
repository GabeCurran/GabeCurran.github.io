                <p>
                    Currently, the experience I'm gaining now revolves around web-design and developing strategies/tools.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most of my prior work has been small jobs for friends/family or fixing computers/software issues. I've also built half a dozen or so computers for various people. I also have hosted many public/private video game servers in the past.
